# multiple-object-tracking-paradigm

This is the multiple object tracking paradigm, as first described by Pylyshyn and Storm (1988). In this very experiment, the objects follow a Brownian motion and expected to indicate all the objects they have been tracking instead of selecting if one object has been tracked or not.

Dependencies: PyGame, PsychoPy
